## Welcome to Deep Codes!

Hello, World! We need to have a chat about front-end development. Deep Codes is a place where me and a handful of talented devs discuss original topics within software development.

Here are some of the topics we aim to start with:

* Front-End Development for Beginners
* A comprehensive, in-depth guide to the DOM
* We're going to document the journey of a beginner to front-end development as she begins here career as well!
* And more of course! Updates coming soon!
